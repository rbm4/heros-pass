# Heros Pass
Welcome to the Heros Pass project!  
This is a collection of code for various spells and version control for Heros Pass â€” a personal Warcraft 3 DOTA spinoff project.

Started back in 2009 when I had no coding skills, this project has grown alongside me as I became a software engineer. Now, I'm bringing those skills back to this childhood project. This repository is here to preserve the code and map, making it available for anyone interested, and to serve as version control for both.

If you find something useful or just want to support the project, feel free to buy me a coffee:
